## Description
UCSD Coding Challenge - Horiseon Social Solution Services

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate accessibility in an html webpage via the usage of semantic html tags.
Given html and css starter code, we refactor such that the code is readable both for viewers and assistive technology.

## Table of Contents
1. index.html - contains the refactored html
2. style.css - contains the refactored css
3. images - directory contains the images used in the webpage
